        <h4>Please Review Proof Carefully</h4>
        <p>As much as we'd like to, we cannot reprint for free if errors are not corrected prior to proof approval and production of cards.</p>
        <p>DOUBLE CHECK all content including phone numbers, addresses, website, spelling and grammar.</p>
        <p>COLOR: this proof is an electronic representation of the printing colors, print position, fonts and other content of the artwork you provided or that we created.</p>
        <p>PLEASE NOTE: colors as viewed on various computer monitors will differ in some degree from the finished printed product. This is because the colors on screen are backlit and illuminated with light. Printed colors are surface lit and generally will not be as bright looking as the on screen proof. The laminate finish applied to plastic cards also tends to darken or bold colors somewhat compared to the same colors printed on paper.</p>
